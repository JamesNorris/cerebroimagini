FPGA -> radix-2 DIT FFT

Variables important to the verilog code are found at the top of each file.

----
	
ADC_DATLEN 		- Number of bits to collect from the ADC before one value of that size is run through DSP
	
ADC_DATLEN_LOG2		- Log2(ADC_DATLEN), used as the reg size required to count up to ADC_DATLEN

FFT_VLEN 		- Vector length of the FFT operation
	
FFT_VLEN_LOG2 		- Log2(FFT_VLEN), used as the reg size required to count up to FFT_VLEN

----

Please note that the testbench files do not have easily-modifiable variables such as this.

To change the twiddle factors you must change the generator parameters accordingly:
